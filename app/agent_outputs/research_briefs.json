Focus on how AI *helps* them or makes things more fun/easier.\n5.  **Structure & Clarity**: Use clear, descriptive headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make the content easy to scan and digest. Break down complex ideas into bite-sized pieces.\n6.  **SERP Insights**: Address common questions directly and concisely, similar to how featured snippets provide quick answers.
