  "writing_instructions": "1. STRUCTURE:\n   - Recommended word count range: 800-1200 words.\n   - Section layout:\n     - Introduction: Hook the reader, introduce AI as a fascinating concept, and state what the article will cover. Keep it simple and exciting.\n     - H2: What is AI? (Provide a very simple, relatable definition).\n     - H2: How Does AI Work? (Explain basic concepts like 'learning' and 'data' using simple analogies).\n     - H2: Where Do We See AI Every Day? (Use relatable examples from kids' lives).\n     - H2: Is AI Good or Bad? (Discuss benefits and simple considerations like privacy/responsible use).\n     - H2: Can Kids Use AI? (Focus on safe, educational, and creative uses).\n     - H2: How Can I Learn More About AI? (Encourage further exploration).\n     - Conclusion: Summarize key takeaways and inspire curiosity about AI's future.\n   - How to use question_keywords as section headings: Integrate the 'question_keywords' directly as H2 headings where possible, or adapt them slightly to fit the flow while retaining the question's essence. For example, 'What is AI?' can be an H2, 'How Does AI Work?' can be an H2, 'Where Do We See AI?' can be 'AI in Our Daily Lives', 'Is AI Good or Bad?' can be 'The Good and Not-So-Good Sides of AI', 'Can Kids Use AI?' can be 'AI Tools for Young Explorers', and 'How Can I Learn About AI?' can be 'Your AI Adventure Starts Here!'.\n\n2. TONE & VOICE:\n   - Writing tone suitable for the target audience and brand: Friendly, curious, encouraging, informative, and slightly playful. The tone should inspire wonder and make complex topics approachable.\n   - Clarity level: Extremely simple and clear. Use short sentences, basic vocabulary, and plenty of analogies. Avoid any technical jargon without immediate, simple explanation.\n   - Emotional framing: Inspiring, wonder-filled, reassuring (not scary or overwhelming), and empowering. Focus on the positive potential and how kids can engage with AI responsibly.\n\n3. SEO PLACEMENT:\n   - Where to place the primary keyword: The primary keyword 'AI for kids' must be in the article title, the first paragraph of the introduction, at least 2-3 H2/H3 headings, and naturally within the conclusion.\n   - How to use secondary keywords naturally: Integrate secondary keywords like 'how AI works for kids', 'examples of AI for kids', and 'benefits of AI for students' naturally within relevant sections to enhance topic coverage without disrupting readability.\n   - Explicit instruction to avoid keyword stuffing: Do NOT force keywords into sentences. Ensure all keywords are used organically and contribute to the article's educational value.\n\n4. CONTENT DEPTH:\n   - Use of examples, scenarios, or explanations: Provide numerous relatable examples from a child's world (e.g., smart speakers, video game characters, recommendation systems on streaming platforms). Use simple 'what if' scenarios to explain concepts. Break down complex ideas into very small, digestible parts.\n   - Balance of benefits and limitations: Highlight the exciting benefits and potential of AI, but also briefly and simply touch upon age-appropriate considerations like privacy, responsible use, and the importance of human judgment.\n   - Instruction to avoid shallow or generic content: Ensure each section offers genuine, simplified insight into AI, avoiding vague statements. Every explanation should be concrete and easy for a 10-14-year-old to grasp.\n\n5. CONSTRAINTS:\n   - What language to avoid: Avoid salesy language, fear-mongering, overly technical jargon, exaggeration, complex statistics, or anything that might sound intimidating or overly academic.\n   - Ethical, cultural, or legal considerations: Briefly mention the importance of using AI responsibly and safely, perhaps with adult supervision. Ensure examples are culturally neutral or broadly relatable, suitable for an Indian audience without being exclusive.\n   - Any safety or brand restrictions: Emphasize safe and supervised interaction with AI tools. The content must align with AstroKids' brand image as an educational, positive, and child-friendly platform. Do not promote unsupervised or risky AI interactions."
